I needed to monitor a server.
It was pretty simple task but tedious to do it twice a day, daily, manually.
That's why I wrote this script. It's only partial automation just as a proof of concept for complete automation.
The data.js contains data in the form of array of objects.
And script.js tries to manipulate based on some key-value pairs.
